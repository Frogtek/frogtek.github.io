                <h4 class="font-weight-light">The problem</h4>
                <p>
                    Our first set of customers are the "mom-and-pop" shops that dot many corners in Latin
                    America and the rest of the developing world. Despite selling hundreds if not thousands of
                    different products, most of these micro-retailers do not track their sales or expenses
                    because they cannot afford a cash register or other point-of-sales tool. The most
                    organized shopkeepers may record some transactions in a notebook and then laboriously
                    transfer this information to a spreadsheet but they generally still do not have a clear
                    idea about how to use this data to improve profits.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The end result is that most of these businesses do not know their break-even sales, cannot
                    analyze an investment opportunity, nor optimize their purchasing decisions. All of these
                    limitations combine to keep micro-retailers operating in a sub-optimal manner, reducing
                    profits, limiting growth and making life more difficult for their suppliers.
                </p>

                <h4 class="font-weight-light">The Solution</h4>
                <p>
                    Our first product is a <a href="http://www.tiendate.mx/" target="_blank">point-of-sale
                    software application </a>that allows micro-retailers to record all store expenses and
                    revenues directly on a mobile phone or tablet; an external bar code reader connected to
                    the phone via a wireless connection allows them to record transactions at the product
                    level. In exchange micro-retailers gain access to financial reporting, personalized
                    recommendations and additional value-added services.
                </p>

                <p>
                    All of our software applications run on Android smart phones or tablets that have touch
                    screens and synchronize wirelessly with our Web servers.

                <h4 class="font-weight-light">The Problem</h4>
                <p>
                    Consumer Packaged Goods (CPGs) companies operate in the traditional chanel of emerging
                    markets blindly, since they do not have high quality, timely, meaningfull information
                    to based their decisions on. Available data are nothing but expensive but low quality
                    extrapolations coming from manual audits that most of the time arrive late and are not
                    actionable.
                </p>
